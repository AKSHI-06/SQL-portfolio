### Course Engagement Analysis

**Objective**: Analyze student engagement data from the 365 platform to understand free-to-paid conversion rates and the durations between key engagement milestones.

**Description**: This project examines student interactions on the 365 platform using data on student registrations, lecture engagements, and purchase history. The analysis aims to derive insights into user behavior and conversion patterns.

Key Metrics Calculated:
* Free-to-Paid Conversion Rate: Percentage of students who watched a lecture and later purchased a subscription.
* Average Duration Between Registration and First-Time Engagement: Average days between registration and the first lecture.
* Average Duration Between First-Time Engagement and First-Time Purchase: Average days between the first lecture and first subscription purchase.

SQL queries were used to extract and aggregate the data, calculate these metrics, and interpret the results, providing insights into user engagement and conversion patterns on the platform.
